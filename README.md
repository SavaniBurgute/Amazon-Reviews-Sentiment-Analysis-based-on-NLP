Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis based on NLP
Project Duration: July 2024 - August 2024

Project Type: Self Project

Project Overview:
This project focuses on the sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objective is to classify reviews as positive or negative by leveraging different machine learning algorithms and comparing their performance.

Key Features:

Data: The dataset comprises over 3,000 Amazon reviews, categorized as positive or negative.
Algorithms Used: The project employed three different classifiers:
Random Forest
XGBoost (XGB)
Decision Tree
Model Evaluation: The accuracy of each model was compared to determine the most effective classifier for the sentiment analysis task.
Highlights:

Grid SearchCV with Random Forest: The Random Forest model was further optimized using Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid SearchCV), resulting in an impressive accuracy of 99% with a standard variance of 0.0076.
Conclusion:
The Random Forest classifier outperformed the other models in this analysis, demonstrating its capability as a robust solution for sentiment analysis in this context.
